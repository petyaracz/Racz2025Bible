replace perplexity with bigram perplexity and call it bigram entropy check
replace complexity with minimum description length / description length and call it MDL / DL check
checked tidytext: removes punctuation and splits on whitespace, converting text to lowercase check
rerun linear models with all outcomes, also with work as ordered factor check
add unigram entropy so the five measures are uni, bi entropy, mdl/dl t/t and wc x
